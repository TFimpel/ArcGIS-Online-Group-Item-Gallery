# ArcGIS-Online-Group-Item-Gallery

The purpose of the ArcGIS-Online-Group-Item-Gallery is to give members of the organization a quick and easy way to access maps and related online resources. Essentially it is a landing page that will display the things your username should see.

The visibility of groups and maps is determined by ArcGIS Online Groups and ArcGIS Online Tags.
By default a number of publicly shared maps are visible. After you sign in you will likely see more groups
and maps: Any ArcGIS Online Group that you are a member of or that is not private, and that is tagged with
the word mappage will be displayed. Any ArcGIS Online item − for example a webmap − that is shared with
this Group and is also tagged with the word mappage will be displayed.

Currently ArcGIS Online items of type Web Map, Web Scene, Web Mapping Application, Operation Views
(browser based) and PDF are supported. Other item types may or may not work.
